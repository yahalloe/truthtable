Here’s a detailed documentation that explains the provided Python code, which generates a truth table for logical expressions involving two variables (`P` and `Q`).

### Purpose:

The purpose of this code is to generate and print a truth table for logical expressions with two variables, `P` and `Q`, using basic logical operations (`and`, `or`, and `not`). The program evaluates user input expressions and generates the corresponding truth table.

---

### 1. **Imports**

```python
import itertools
```

The `itertools` module is imported to generate all possible combinations of truth values (`True` and `False`) for the variables `P` and `Q`. Specifically, we use the `itertools.product()` function, which creates Cartesian products.

---

### 2. **Logical Operation Functions**

```python
def logical_and(p, q):
    return p and q

def logical_or(p, q):
    return p or q

def logical_not(p):
    return not p
```

These are custom functions that simulate basic logical operations:

- `logical_and(p, q)`: Returns `True` if both `p` and `q` are `True`, otherwise returns `False`.
- `logical_or(p, q)`: Returns `True` if either `p` or `q` is `True`, otherwise returns `False`.
- `logical_not(p)`: Returns the negation of `p` (`True` becomes `False`, and `False` becomes `True`).

These functions are used in place of Python’s built-in logical operators to ensure the logic of the truth table is computed manually.

---

### 3. **Expression Evaluation**

```python
def evaluate_expression(variables, combination, expression):
```

This function takes three arguments:

- `variables`: A list of logical variables (`P` and `Q` in this case).
- `combination`: A tuple representing one combination of truth values for the variables (e.g., `(True, False)`).
- `expression`: The logical expression input by the user (e.g., `P and Q`).

#### a. **Context Creation**

```python
context = dict(zip(variables, combination))
```

The `context` dictionary maps variables to their corresponding truth values. For example, if the variables are `["P", "Q"]` and the combination is `(True, False)`, the `context` will be `{"P": True, "Q": False}`.

#### b. **Replacing Logical Operators**

```python
expression = expression.replace("and", " and ")
expression = expression.replace("or", " or ")
expression = expression.replace("not", " not ")
```

This ensures that logical operators (`and`, `or`, and `not`) have proper spacing so they can be evaluated later. If operators in the user's expression are not properly spaced, this step ensures they are formatted correctly.

#### c. **Substituting Variables**

```python
for var, val in context.items():
    expression = expression.replace(var, str(val))
```

This loop replaces the variables (`P` and `Q`) in the expression with their corresponding truth values from the `context` dictionary. For example, if the expression is `P and Q` and `context` is `{"P": True, "Q": False}`, the expression becomes `True and False`.

#### d. **Manual Evaluation of Tokens**

```python
tokens = expression.split()
```

The expression is split into individual tokens (components) to be evaluated manually. For example, the expression `True and False` becomes `['True', 'and', 'False']`.

#### e. **Logical Evaluation Loop**

The program iterates through each token to compute the final result based on logical operations:

- If the token is `"True"` or `"False"`, it updates the `result` accordingly.
- If the token is a logical operator (`and` or `or`), it stores the operator and applies it to the next truth value.

---

### 4. **Generating the Truth Table**

```python
def generate_truth_table():
```

This function generates and prints the truth table based on user input.

#### a. **User Input**

```python
variables = ["P", "Q"]
expression = input("Enter the logical expression (e.g., P and Q and not P): ")
```

The user is prompted to enter a logical expression involving `P` and `Q`.

#### b. **Generating All Combinations of Truth Values**

```python
combinations = list(itertools.product([True, False], repeat=len(variables)))
```

The `itertools.product([True, False], repeat=2)` function generates all possible combinations of truth values for `P` and `Q`. Since there are two variables, it generates four combinations:

- `(True, True)`
- `(True, False)`
- `(False, True)`
- `(False, False)`

#### c. **Printing the Table Header**

```python
header = " | ".join(variables) + " | Result"
print(header)
print("-" * len(header))
```

The header of the truth table is printed, showing the variables `P`, `Q`, and the result. A separator line is also printed for formatting.

#### d. **Evaluating and Printing Each Row**

```python
for combination in combinations:
    result = evaluate_expression(variables, combination, expression)
    row = " | ".join(map(str, combination)) + " | " + str(result)
    print(row)
```

For each combination of truth values, the `evaluate_expression()` function is called to compute the result. The result is printed along with the corresponding truth values for `P` and `Q`.

---

### 5. **Running the Program**

```python
generate_truth_table()
```

This line starts the program by calling the `generate_truth_table()` function, which handles input, computation, and output.

---

### Example Output:

If the user enters the expression `P and Q or not P`, the truth table might look like this:

```
P | Q | Result
----------------
True | True | True
True | False | True
False | True | True
False | False | False
```

- When `P` is `True` and `Q` is `True`, the result is `True and True or not True`, which evaluates to `True`.
- When `P` is `False` and `Q` is `False`, the result is `False and False or not False`, which evaluates to `False`.

---

### Conclusion:

This program provides a simple way to evaluate logical expressions involving two variables (`P` and `Q`) and generate a truth table. It manually handles logical operations and avoids using `eval()` to keep the evaluation transparent.
